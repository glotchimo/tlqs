The tutor view is made to be simple, ensuring that everything that you need is there and easy to access. 
The expected flow of the view is that the tutor sees the students' problem and from there they can get an idea of what they need to work on with the student. 
Once the tutor has added their comments on the session and marked it as completed, the next student in the queue will enter and the cycle will repeat till all sessions are completed.


## View Break Downs

### Session Glance
The session glance view is the main view that the tutor is going to interact with. 
It's broken up into two halves.

- One side of the screen is reserved to diplaying the problem. So, when a student submit's a ticket all their information relevant to solving the problem will be displayed on the left hand side of the screen.
- The other side is going to be reserved strictly for the tutor on this half of the screen the tutor will be adding their comments on the session, the text field supports **markdown** so a preview button is provided to see the rendered out comment. Once, the notes are completed The tutor will be able to mark it as completed and remove the session from the queue. 
 
### Queue quick glance
This view is meant for a Tutor to get a quick glance of who's left in the queue. The flow of the queue goes from ***left to right***. 

- Each student card, has simple information on who the student is and the topic that they will need help on.
