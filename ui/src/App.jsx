//Was not able to find api route today. So utilized a test api to figure out how I would approach fetching and displaying data.

import * as React from "react";
import TutorMain from "./tutor/TutorMain";
import FetchSession from "./tutor/FetchSessions";
export default () => {
  return (
    <>
      <TutorMain />
    </>
  );
};
