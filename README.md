# Tutor Lab Queue System
This is the monorepo for TLQS, containing a React SPA and a Go back-end. It features a Dockerfile for quick containerized deployment and a Makefile for a rapid build-test-edit cycle.

To build and run the service, run `make run`, and to clean up binaries and distribution files, run `make clean`.
